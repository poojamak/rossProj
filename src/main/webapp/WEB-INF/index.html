    Principle component analysis is a tool to determine which dimension of the data is the important one.
    It is easy to visualize and understand the data with lower dimensions.
    When 3D graph is more understandable compared to multidimensional graph.
    Principle component analysis involves a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of correlate variable
    into a number.
</p>

<p>
    PCA techniques finds the priciple dimensions of the data.
    principle components are underlying structure of the data. It is the direction where there is most variance,
    the directions where data is most spread out. They are the underlying structure in the data, meaning that it is
    useful
    to measure data in terms of its principle components than on normal x- y axis. As we know if the data variation is
    directly proportional to
    the information which can be extracted from the data set. Hence we call the dimensions as the most important ones
    which has most variation.
</p>

<h4>How to determine PCA</h4>

<p>
    We need to use mathematical formulas to find out the in which direction most variance is happening.
    We determine uncorrelated components of the data set and these uncorreletaed variables are nothing but principle
    components.
    Discuss math formulas here. This is where calculating eigen values and eigen vectors comes in picture.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p>
    Eigenvalue associated with each principle component tells you how much variation in the data set
    it explains. It is the clearly a percentage of the total variation in the data set.
    <br>
    Eigen vectors are just the linear combinations of the orignal variable(in a simple and rotated space).
    These eigen vectors describe how variables contribute to each factor axis.
    <br>Principle component analysis is as a way to construct new axes that point to the directions of maximal
    variance expressed by the eigen value and eigen vector determines the direction.
</p>

<h4>Why do we need PCA</h4>

<p>
    <b>1. </b>To reduce the dimentionality of the data<br>
    <b>2. </b>To identify meaningful variables
</p>

<h4>Non mathematical take on PCA </h4>

<p>
    Suppose we have just opend a wine shop. We have nearly 30 varieties of wine and i need to sort them to allocate
    space on shelf so that it will be easy
    sell according to customer needs hence we put similar tasting wines on same shelf.
    There are lots of different tastes and textures in wine - sweetness, tartness, bitterness, yeastiness, fruitiness
    etc.
    So what I need to do to put the bottles into categories is answer two questions:
    <br> 1) What qualities are most important for identifying groups of wines? e.g. does classifying based on
    sweetness make it easier to group your wine into similar-tasting groups than classifying based on
    how old is the wine?

    <br><br> 2) Can we reduce our list of variables by combining some of them? e.g. is there actually a variable
    that is some combination of "yeastiness and clarity and fizziness" and which makes a really good scale for
    classifying varieties?

    This is essentially what PCA does. Principal components are variables that usefully explain variation in a data
    set - in this case, that usefully differentiate between groups. Each principal component is one of your original
    explanatory variables, or a combination of some of your original explanatory variables.
</p>

<h4>layman's term</h4>

<p>There are as many principal components as there are variables.
    The first principal component is the best straight line you can fit to the data.
    The second principal component is the best straight line you can fit to the errors from the first principal
    component.The third principal component is the best straight line you can fit to the errors from the first and second
    principal components, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
    PCA is a technique to reduce dimension by:
    <br><b>1. </b>Taking linear combinations of the original variables.
    <br><b>2. </b>Each linear combination explains the most variance in the data it can.
    <br><b>3. </b>Each linear combination is uncorrelated with the others

</p>

<h4>Assumption on PCA</h4>
All multiple variables should be measured in continuous level.
<br><b>1. </b> There needs to be linear relationship between all the variables.
<br><b>2. </b> You should have sampling frequency which means that for PCA tp produce a reliable result, large enough
sample sizes are required.
<br><b>3. </b> Data is suitable for data reduction that is we need to have adequate correlations
between variables i order for variables to be reduced to a smaller number of components.
<br><b>4. </b> There should be no significant outliers. out
